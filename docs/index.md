# Designing with Words

With 10 years of experience in technical communication, I can create user-centered content for product interfaces and help systems. I have always advocated for clear, consistent writing that facilitates understanding of complex concepts and task completion. My body of work includes documentation, microcopy, style guides, terminology lists, and process documents.

# What I Do

## UX Writing

_Creating user-centered content for web and mobile applications_

I write interface text (also known as "microcopy") that addresses what users feel and need at each step of their user journey.

## Documentation Writing

_Building help systems that enable users to complete tasks_

I specialize in structured authoring, which is a standardized, methodological approach to content creation.

## Content Strategy

_Designing conversations between products and users_

I establish content types, structures, and formats, and use technology to efficiently develop, manage, and deliver content.
